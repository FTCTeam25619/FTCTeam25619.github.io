      <h1>About Nova Pyra</h1>

      <p>Nova Pyra is a <em>FIRST</em><sup>&copy;</sup> Tech Challenge competition team (FTC Team 25619) based at
        Mandeville Junior High in Mandeville, LA. We were formed in 2024.

        Our first competition season was the 2024-2025 INTO THE DEEP&#8480; presented by RTX<sup>&copy;</sup> season.
      </p>

      <h2>Our team name</h2>

      <p>As the younger sibling to <a href="https://mandevillerobotics.org" target="_blank">FRC team 2992 The SS
          Prometheus</a>, our FTC team, Nova Pyra, draws deep inspiration from the Greek mythology of Prometheus, the
        titan who defied the gods to grant fire to humanity. This myth symbolizes the power of knowledge, innovation,
        and the spark of creativity &mdash; all essential elements in the world of robotics.</p>

      <p>Our team name, &ldquo;Nova Pyra,&rdquo; is a fusion of Latin and Greek roots, translating to &ldquo;New
        Fire.&rdquo; This name represents not only the literal fire granted by Prometheus but also the figurative flame
        of passion, ingenuity, and renewal that our team embodies. After years without an FTC team at our school, Nova
        Pyra marks the dawn of a new era.</p>

      <h2>Our logo</h2>

      <div class="flex flex-row justify-stretch items-start">
        <img class="max-w-[250px] mr-6 mt-4" src="/assets/images/NovaPyra_Logo_Concept.jpg" alt="Nova Pyra logo" />
        <div class="flex-1">
          <p>The logo itself captures this essence with a central blue flame, symbolizing both the fire of Prometheus
            and the spirit of innovation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The wings flanking the flame are reminiscent of the phoenix, a creature that rises from its ashes, symbolizing
        our team's rebirth. Together, the flame and wings illustrate our journey &mdash; a new team rising with renewed
        energy and determination, ready to soar to new heights.</p>

      <p>Nova Pyra is more than just a team. We are igniting a new fire within our school and community and lighting the
        path for future generations of innovators. We are proud to represent this rebirth and look forward to the
        challenges and triumphs that lie ahead.</p>

      <h2>About the program</h2>

      <div class="flex flex-row justify-stretch items-start">
        <div class="flex-1">
          <p><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc"><em>FIRST</em><sup>&copy;</sup> Tech Challenge</a> is
            a robotics competition program where teams of up to 15 members, grades 7-12, design, build, program, and
            operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.</p>

          alt="FIRST Tech Challenge logo" />
      </div>

      <p>Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles,
        while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team. Teams design and build robots, raise
        funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to earn specific awards. Each season
        concludes with regional championship events and an exciting FIRST Championship.</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s way more than building robots, and we're excited to be a part of the fun and excitement!</p>
