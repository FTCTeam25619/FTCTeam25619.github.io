          <p>We competed in the INTO THE DEEP&#8480; presented by RTX<sup>&copy;</sup> competition season, where we <a href="/successes.html">won various awards, qualified for Regionals, and were on the winning alliance at the Louisiana State Championship</a>. Even though we did not go to worlds, we accomplished so much in our rookie year.</p>
            <p>Our robot had a holonomic drivetrain ideal for required tasks and maneuverability. We bought a kit for our drivetrain for simplicity purposes and because this was our rookie year.</p>
            <p>Our robot's intake included two parts, two wheels and the grucket. The wheels spun to take in pieces to pass to the grucket. The grucket, a combination of the words grip and bucket, was a bucket with a grip to grab and keep grip of pieces recieved by the two-wheel intake.</p> 
          
          <div>  
          <p>We also added other features, such as 3d-printed hooks to allow us to climb, wheel covers to protect the wheels from getting damaged, lights to signal the drivers of when a piece was taken into the intake, and color sensors to tell what color pieces were entering the intake. </p>
          <p>We dedicated this season to one of our founding teammates, Jeremiah Bivins. <a href="members.html">Find
