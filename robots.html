          <p>We competed in the INTO THE DEEP&#8480; presented by RTX<sup>&copy;</sup> competition season and won various awards, seen <a href="events.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Our goals for this robot were to be able to score samples and specimens efficiently, succeed in performing a 2nd-level climb conststently, and have an overall fast and efficient robot, capable of conststently winning matches with exceptionally high scores.</p>  
          <p>Our robot had a holonomic drivetrain ideal for required tasks and maneuverability. The mecanum wheels are able to drive forwards and backwards, strafe, and drive diagonally, making them very versatile and maneuverable. We bought a kit for our drivetrain for simplicity purposes and because this was our rookie year.</p>
            <p>Our robot's intake included two parts, two wheels and the grucket. The wheels spun to take in pieces to pass to the grucket. The grucket, a combination of the words grip and bucket, was a bucket with a grip to grab and keep grip of pieces recieved by the two-wheel intake.</p> 
          <p>We also added other features, such as 3d-printed hooks to allow us to climb, wheel covers to protect the wheels from getting damaged, lights to signal the drivers of when a piece was taken into the intake, and color sensors to tell what color pieces were entering the intake. </p>
