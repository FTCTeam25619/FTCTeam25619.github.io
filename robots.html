          <p>We competed in the INTO THE DEEP&#8480; presented by RTX<sup>&copy;</sup> competition season and won
            various awards, seen <a href="events.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Information about the INTO THE DEEP&#8480; game can be found <a
              href="https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/archive/2025/game">here</a>, and you can find out
            details about our robot for said season <a href="robots.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Our strategy for this season consisted of prioritizing samples over specimens, but we still wanted to be
            flexible, so our robot was capable of scoring both. We also aimed for a 2nd-level climb in most of our
            matches during this season. Our robot was able to detect what color pieces we were intaking, so we aimed to
            score mostly alliance-neutral pieces because they were available for both alliances, and by aiming to
            collect yellow pieces, we prevented the opposing alliance from scoring as many pieces.</p>

          
          <p>Our goals for this robot were to be able to score samples and specimens efficiently, succeed in performing
            a 2nd-level climb conststently, and have an overall fast and efficient robot, capable of conststently
            winning matches with exceptionally high scores.</p>
          <p>Our robot had a holonomic drivetrain ideal for required tasks and maneuverability. The mecanum wheels are
            able to drive forwards and backwards, strafe, and drive diagonally, making them very versatile and
            maneuverable. We bought a kit for our drivetrain for simplicity purposes and because this was our rookie
            year.</p>
          <p>Our robot's intake included two parts, two wheels and the grucket. The wheels spun to take in pieces to
            pass to the grucket. The grucket, a combination of the words grip and bucket, was a bucket with a grip to
            grab and keep grip of pieces recieved by the two-wheel intake.</p>
          <p>We also added other features, such as 3d-printed hooks to allow us to climb, wheel covers to protect the
            wheels from getting damaged, lights to signal the drivers of when a piece was taken into the intake, and
            color sensors to tell what color pieces were entering the intake. </p>
          <p>Outreach during this season included assisting & collaborating with other teams, summer training sessions,
            participation in the STEAM Night event hosted by Pontchartrain Elementary, completing a mural in the Science
            Lab at Mandeville Junior High, and attending a Zoom meeting with FTC EagleBots. Fundraising was mainly
            achieved through sponsorships from other businesses, found <a href="sponsors.html">here</a>, but we also
            recieved a grant from the Deborah Rochelle Foundation.</p>
            <p>Overall this season was a very successful season, and it provided a very important foundation for our team.
          </p>
          <p>We dedicated this season to one of our founding teammates, Jeremiah Bivins. <a href="members.html">Find
