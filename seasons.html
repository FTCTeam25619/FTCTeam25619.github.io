          <p>We competed in the INTO THE DEEP&#8480; presented by RTX<sup>&copy;</sup> competition season, where we <a href="/successes.html">won various awards, qualified for Regionals, and were on the winning alliance at the Louisiana State Championship</a>. Even though we did not go to worlds, we accomplished so much in our rookie year.</p>
            <p>Information about the INTO THE DEEP&#8480; game can be found <a href="https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/archive/2025/game">here</a>, and you can find out details about our robot for said season <a href="robots.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Our strategy for this season consisted of prioritizing samples over specimens, but we still wanted to be flexible, so our robot was capable of scoring both. We also aimed for a 2nd-level climb in most of our matches during this season. Our robot was able to detect what color pieces we were intaking, so we aimed to score mostly alliance-neutral pieces because they were available for both alliances, and by aiming to collect yellow pieces, we prevented the opposing alliance from scoring as many pieces.</p> 
            <p>Outreach during this season included assisting & collaborating with other teams, summer training sessions, participation in the STEAM Night event hosted by Pontchartrain Elementary, completing a mural in the Science Lab at Mandeville Junior High, and attending a Zoom meeting with FTC EagleBots. Fundraising was mainly achieved through sponsorships from other businesses, found <a href="sponsors.html">here</a>, but we also recieved a grant from the Deborah Rochelle Foundation.</p>
          <p>Overall this season was a very successful season, and it provided a very important foundation for our team.</p>
          <p>Information about specific events during this season can be found <a href="events.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p>We dedicated this season to one of our founding teammates, Jeremiah Bivins. <a href="members.html">Find
